LRMouseWheel
============

32-bit Lightroom for Windows plugin that adds mousewheel support

I wrote this about three years ago and recently decided to open source it...
Not necessarily because I think anyone will use it... but just to have a record that I did it.

It's not 100% complete, but works fine for child windows of the main window
(windows within dialogs don't work yet... but this was much lower priority for me)

There's a short fluff write up here http://checkyourexposure.com/p/100/hacking-lightroom-mouse-wheel-support but the meat is in the source code.


And in case it isn't obvious, I make no claims or warranties on this software.
By using this software, you agree not to hold me liable in the event one of your catalogs gets corrupted,
your computer catches fire, or any other possible outcome.
